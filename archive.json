The entries in this model seem reasonable to me. But we don't have even an adopted framework for this work! It might have broader application than ALTO (there are certainly use cases that could take advantage of this collection without using ALTO), and I think it's premature to design this and tie it to an ALTO model. If there is to be work on data collection, it would be reasonable to build a common framework for it, and then publish an appropriate YANG model.\r\n",

It basically divides the ALTO server functionality into a bunch of arbitrary components and maps each of those components to a YANG module. Furthermore, the actual mapping doesn't really add a bunch of insight: stats/monitoring gets ietf-alto-stats and everything else uses ietf-alto, which seems pretty obvious without hundreds of words. In my opinion, this doesn't really add anything to the spec at all. If you really must retain it, maybe this can move to an appendix?",

My one issue is that when I tried to actually understand, by reading this document and the two RFCs to which it referred, how the YANG model represents the NAPTR record, I failed.

In particular, NAPTR records contain quite a few fields, e.g. order and preference, and these fields are not mentioned in the YANG data model.
