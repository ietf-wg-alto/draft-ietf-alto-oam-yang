                    draft-ietf-alto-oam-yang-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a YANG data model for Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) & Management of the
   Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol.  The operator
   of an ALTO server can use this data model to (1) set up the ALTO
   server, (2) configure server discovery, (3) create, update and remove
   ALTO information resources, (4) manage the access control of each
   ALTO information resource, and (5) collect statistical data from the
   ALTO server.  The application provider can also use this data model
   to configure ALTO clients to communicate with known ALTO servers.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a YANG data model for the Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) & Management of Application-
   Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) Protocol.  The basic purpose of
   this YANG data model is discussed in Section 16 of [RFC7285].

   The operator of an ALTO server can use this data model to:

   *  set up the ALTO server,

   *  configure server discovery,

   *  create, update and remove ALTO information resources,

   *  manage the access control of each ALTO information resource,

   *  collect statistical data of the ALTO server.

   The application provider can also use this data model to configure
   ALTO clients to communicate with known ALTO servers.

   Section 4.1 describes what is and is not in scope.  Section 4.2 and
   Section 4.3 define more concrete requirements for the data model.

   The basic structure of this YANG data model is guided by Section 16
   of [RFC7285] and [RFC7971].  Although the scope of the YANG data
   model in this document mainly focuses on the support of the base ALTO
   protocol [RFC7285] and the existing ALTO standard extensions:
   [RFC8189], [RFC8895], [RFC8896], [RFC9240], [RFC9241], [RFC9274],
   [RFC9275], and [RFC9439].

   The detailed design of the data model is illustrated in Section 5 and
   Section 6.  Some examples of how to extend this data model for
   specific ALTO server implementations are shown in Appendix A.

   The YANG data models in this document conform to the Network
   Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA) defined in [RFC8342].

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.  When the words appear in lower case, they
   are to be interpreted with their natural language meanings.

   [RFC8340].

3.2.  Prefixes in Data Node Names

   The complete name of a data node or data model object includes a
   prefix, which indicates the YANG module in which the name is defined.
   In this document, the prefix is omitted when the YANG module is clear
   from the context; otherwise, the prefix is included.  The prefixes
   indicating the corresponding YANG modules are shown in Table 1.

3.3.  Placeholders in Reference Statements

   Note to the RFC Editor: This section is to be removed prior to
   publication.

   This document contains placeholder values that need to be replaced
   with finalized values at the time of publication.  This note
   summarizes all of the substitutions that are needed.  No other RFC
   Editor instructions are specified elsewhere in this document.

   Please apply the following replacements:

   *  GGGG --> the assigned RFC number for
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-http-client-server]

   *  HHHH --> the assigned RFC number for
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-netconf-client-server]

   *  IIII --> the assigned RFC number for
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-restconf-client-server]

   *  XXXX --> the assigned RFC number for this draft

4.  Design Scope and Requirements

4.1.  Scope of Data Models for ALTO O&M

   The following items are in the scope of the data models specified in
   this document:

   *  Deploying an ALTO server/client.

   *  Operating and managing an ALTO server/client.

   *  Configuring functionality/capability configuration of ALTO
      services.

   *  Monitoring ALTO-related performance metrics.

   This document does not normatively define any data model related to a
   specific implementation, including:

   *  Data structures for how to store/deliver ALTO information
      resources (e.g., database schema to store a network map).

   *  Data structures for how to store information collected from data
      sources. (e.g., database schema to store topology collected from
      an Interface to the Routing System (I2RS) client [RFC7921])

   Likewise, the specification does not cover considerations that are
   specific to the ALTO Transport Information Publication Service (TIPS)
   [RFC9569].  Specifically, considerations related to HTTP/3 are out of
   scope.

   For convenience, examples of how related extensions can be defined
   are provided in the Appendices.

4.2.  Basic Requirements

4.3.  Additional Requirements for Extensibility

   R8: As the ALTO protocol is extensible, the data models for ALTO O&M
   should allow for augmentation to support potential future extensions.

5.  Design of ALTO O&M Data Model

5.1.  Overview of ALTO O&M Data Model

   The "ietf-alto" module is designed to fit all the requirements listed
   in Section 4.

   As shown in Figure 1, the top-level container "alto" in the "ietf-
   alto" module contains a list "alto-client" and a single "alto-server"
   container.

   The "alto-client" list defines a list of configurations for other
   applications to bootstrap an ALTO client.  These data nodes can also
   be used by data sources and information resource creation algorithms
   that are configured by an ALTO server instance.

   The container "alto-server" contains both configuration and
   operational data of an administrated ALTO server instance.

            module: ietf-alto
              +--rw alto!
                 +--rw alto-client* [client-id] {alto-client}?
                 |  ...
                 +--rw alto-server {alto-server}?
                    +...
                    +--rw auth-client* [client-id]
                    |  ...
                    +--rw role* [role-name]
                    |  +--rw role-name    role-name
                    |  +--rw client*      client-ref
                    +--rw data-source* [source-id]
                    |  ...
                    +--rw resource* [resource-id]
                       ...

                     Figure 1: IETF ALTO Tree Structure

5.2.  Data Model for ALTO Client Operation and Management

   As shown in Figure 2, the "alto-client" contains a list of client-
   side configurations.  Each "alto-client" entry contains the following
   data nodes:

   "client-id":  A unique identifier that can be referenced by other
      applications.

   "server-discovery-client":  A container that is used to configure how
      this ALTO client discovers an ALTO server.

            module: ietf-alto
              +--rw alto!
                 +--rw alto-client* [client-id] {alto-client}?
                 |  +--rw client-id                  string
                 |  +--rw server-discovery
                 |     +---u alto-server-discovery-client
                  ...

                Figure 2: IETF ALTO Client Subtree Structure

5.3.  Data Model for Server-level Operation and Management

   The ALTO server instance contains a set of data nodes for server-
   level operation and management for ALTO that are shown in Figure 3.
   This structure satisfies R1 - R4 in Section 4.2.

           module: ietf-alto
             +--rw alto!
                ...
                +--rw alto-server {alto-server}?
                   +--rw listen
                   |  +---u alto-server-listen-stack
                   +--rw server-discovery
                   |  +---u alto-server-discovery
                   +--rw logging-system
                   |  +---u alto-logging-system
                   +--rw cost-type* [cost-type-name]
                   |  +--rw cost-type-name    cost-type-name
                   |  +--rw cost-mode         identityref

                   |  +--rw description?      string
                   |  +--rw cost-context {performance-metrics}?
                   |     +--rw cost-source    identityref
                   |     +--rw parameters

5.3.1.  Data Model for ALTO Server Setup

   To satisfy R1 in Section 4.2, the ALTO server instance contains the
   basic data nodes for the server setup that are detailed in the
   following subsections.

5.3.1.1.  ALTO Server Listen Stack

   The container "listen" contains all the data nodes for the whole
   server listen stack across TCP, TLS, HTTP and application layers
   (Figure 4).

                grouping alto-server:
                  +-- base-uri?   inet:uri
                grouping alto-server-listen-stack:
                  +-- (transport)
                     +--:(http) {http-listen}?
                     |  +-- http
                     |     +-- tcp-server-parameters
                     |     |  +---u tcp:tcp-server-grouping
                     |     +-- http-server-parameters
                     |     |  +---u http:http-server-grouping
                     |     +-- alto-server-parameters
                     |        +---u alto-server
                     +--:(https)
                        +-- https
                           +-- tcp-server-parameters
                           |  +---u tcp:tcp-server-grouping
                           +-- tls-server-parameters
                           |  +---u tls:tls-server-grouping
                           +-- http-server-parameters
                           |  +---u http:http-server-grouping
                           +-- alto-server-parameters
                              +---u alto-server

               Figure 4: IETF ALTO Server Groupings Structure

   The "transport" choice node enables which protocol layers to be
   configured.  By default, two cases are defined for different
   deployment scenarios:

   *  The "http" case is provided to support scenarios where the TLS-
      termination is handled by other external components, e.g., reverse
      proxies or ingress controllers.

   *  The "https" case is provided to support scenarios where the whole
      HTTPS server listen stack including TLS is handled by the ALTO
      server itself.

5.3.1.2.  ALTO Server Discovery Setup

   In practice, for a large-scale network consisting of multiple
   administrative domains, the information about the network may be
   partitioned and distributed over multiple ALTO servers.  That may
   require discovery and communication among different ALTO servers.

   The "ietf-alto" module provides the configuration for how an ALTO
   server can be discovered by another ALTO server or client on demand
   (Figure 5).  However, it does not contain any configuration for the
   communication among ALTO servers because the related solution has not
   become a standard.  Future documents may extend it to fully support
   multi-domain scenarios.

           grouping alto-server-discovery:
             +-- (method)?
                +--:(reverse-dns) {xdom-disc}?
                   +-- rdns-naptr-records
                      +-- static-prefix*           inet:ip-prefix
                      +-- dynamic-prefix-source*   data-source-ref

          Figure 5: IETF ALTO Server Discovery Grouping Structure

   The "server-discovery" node provides configuration for the discovery
   of ALTO servers using a variety of mechanisms.  The initial version
   of the "ietf-alto" module only defines the "reverse-dns" case that is
   used to configure DNS NAPTR records for ALTO server discovery as
   suggested by [RFC7286] and [RFC8686].  It configures a set of
   endpoints that can be served by this ALTO server.  The node contains
   two leaf lists.  The "static" list contains a list of manually
   configured endpoints.  The "dynamic" list points to a list of data
   sources to retrieve the endpoints dynamically.  As suggested by
   [RFC7286] and [RFC8686], the IP prefixes of the endpoints configured
   by both "static" and "dynamic" lists will be translated into DNS
   NAPTR resource records for server discovery.  The "server-discovery-
   manner" choice can be augmented by the future modules to support
   other mechanisms.

5.3.2.  Data Model for Logging Management

   To satisfy R2 in Section 4.2, the ALTO server instance contains the
   the logging data nodes shown in Figure 6.

   The "logging-system" data node provides configuration to select a
   logging system to capture log messages generated by an ALTO server.

   By default, "syslog" is the only supported logging system.  When
   selecting "syslog", the related configuration is delegated to the
   configuration file of the syslog [RFC5424] server.

                   grouping alto-logging-system:
                     +-- (logging-system)?
                        +--:(syslog)
                           +-- syslog-params
                              +-- config-file?   inet:uri

           Figure 6: IETF ALTO Logging System Grouping Structure

   A specific server implementation can extend the "logging-system" node
   to add other logging systems.

5.3.3.  Data Model for ALTO-related Management

   To satisfy R3 in Section 4.2, the data model contains the following
   ALTO-related management information (Figure 3):

   *  The "cost-type" list is the registry for the cost types that can
      be used in the ALTO server.

   *  The "meta" list contains the customized meta data of the ALTO
      server.  It is populated into the meta field of the default
      Information Resource Directory (IRD).

5.3.4.  Data Model for Security Management

   To satisfy R4 in Section 4.2, the data model leverages HTTP and TLS
   to provide basic security management for an ALTO server.  All the
   related configurations are covered by the server listen stack.

5.4.  Data Model for ALTO Server Configuration Management

5.4.1.  Data Source Configuration Management

   To satisfy R5-1 in Section 4.2, the ALTO server instance contains a
   list of "data-source" entries to subscribe the data sources from
   which ALTO information resources are derived (Section 16.2.4 of
   [RFC7285]).

         module: ietf-alto
           +--rw alto!
              ...
              +--rw alto-server {alto-server}?
                 ...
                 +--rw data-source* [source-id]
                 |  +--rw source-id                    source-id
                 |  +--rw source-type                  identityref
                 |  +--rw source-params
                 ...

          Figure 7: IETF ALTO Server Data Source Subtree Structure

   As shown in Figure 7, a "data-source" list entry includes:

   *  A unique "source-id" for resource creation algorithms to
      reference.

   *  The "source-type" attribute to declare the type of the data
      source.

   *  The "source-params" to specify where and how to query the data.

   The "data-source/source-params" node can be augmented for different
   types of data sources.  Note that the purpose of this node is not to
   fully set up the communication mechanisms for specific data sources,
   but to maintain how data sources are configured and expose them to
   the ALTO server.

   This data model only includes a basic structure for an ALTO server to
   correctly interact with a data source.  The implementation-specific
   parameters of any certain data source can be augmented in another
   module.  An example is included in Appendix A.3.

5.4.2.  ALTO Information Resources Configuration Management

   To satisfy R5-2 and R-3 in Section 4.2, the ALTO server instance
   contains a list of "resource" entries (Figure 8).  Each "resource"
   entry contains the data nodes of an ALTO information resource (See
   Section 8.1 of [RFC7285]).  The operator of the ALTO server can use
   this model to create, update, and remove the ALTO information
   resources.

   Each "resource" entry provides data nodes defining how to create or
   update an ALTO information resource.  Adding a new "resource" entry
   notifies the ALTO server to create a new ALTO information resource.
   Updating an existing "resource" entry notifies the ALTO server to
   update the generation parameters (e.g., capabilities and the creation
   algorithm) of an existing ALTO information resource.  Removing an
   existing "resource" entry will remove the corresponding ALTO
   information resource.

     module: ietf-alto
       +--rw alto!
          ...
          +--rw alto-server {alto-server}?
             ...

       grouping algorithm:
         +-- (algorithm)

               Figure 8: IETF ALTO Resource Subtree Structure

   A "resource" list entry MUST include a unique "resource-id" and a
   "resource-type".

   It may also include an "accepted-role" node containing a list of
   "role-name"s that is used by role-based access control for this ALTO
   information resource.  See Section 5.4.3 for details of information
   resource access control.

   For some "resource-type", the "resource" entry may also include a
   "dependency" node containing the "resource-id" of the dependent ALTO
   information resources (Section 9.1.5 of [RFC7285]).

   For each type of ALTO information resource, the "resource" entry may
   also need type-specific parameters.  These type-specific parameters
   can be split into two categories:

   1.  One category of the type-specific parameters is common for the
       same type of ALTO information resource.  They declare the
       Capabilities attribute of the ALTO information resource
       (Section 9.1.3 of [RFC7285]).

   2.  The other category of the type-specific parameters is algorithm-
       specific.  The developer of the ALTO server can implement their
       own creation algorithms and augment the "algorithm" node to
       declare algorithm-specific input parameters.

   Except for the "ird" resource, all the other types of "resource"
   entries have an augmented "algorithm" node.  The augmented
   "algorithm" node can reference data sources subscribed by the "data-
   source" entries (See Section 5.4.1).  An example of extending the
   "algorithm" node for a specific type of "resource" is included in
   Appendix A.4.

   The developer does not have to customize the creation algorithm of
   the "ird" resource.  The default "ird" resource will be created
   automatically based on all the added "resource" entries.  The
   delegated "ird" resource will be created as a static ALTO information
   resource (Section 9.2.4 of [RFC7285]).

   Each "resource" entry may also set thresholds of memory usage and
   active update streams (if "incr-update" feature is enabled).  Table 3
   describes limits that, once exceeded, will trigger notifications to
   be generated:

   +=========================+========================================+
   | Notification Threshold  | Description                            |
   +=========================+========================================+

   |                         | server instance.  When exceeded, an    |
   |                         | alto-resource-event will be generated. |

   |                         | update streams that are serviced by an |
   |                         | update resource configured to an ALTO  |
   |                         | server instance.  When exceeded, an    |
   |                         | alto-resource-event will be generated. |

                    Table 3: Notification Thresholds.

5.4.3.  ALTO Information Resource Access Control Management

   To satisfy R-3 in Section 4.2 and as per Section 15.5.2 of [RFC7285],
   the "ietf-alto" module also defines authentication and authorization
   related configuration to employ access control at the information
   resource level.  The ALTO server returns the IRD to the ALTO client
   based on its authentication information.

   The information resource access control is supported using the
   structure shown in Figure 9.

     module: ietf-alto
       +--rw alto!
          ...
          +--rw alto-server {alto-server}?

             |           |  +---u inline-or-truststore-public-key-ref
             |           +--rw tls12-psks?       empty
             |           |       {tls:client-auth-tls12-psk}?
             |           +--rw tls13-epsks?      empty
             |                   {tls:client-auth-tls13-epsk}?

             |  +--rw client*      client-ref
             ...

        Figure 9: IETF ALTO Client Authentication Subtree Structure

   The structure shown in Figure 9 can be used to configure the role-
   based access control:

   *  "auth-client" declares a list of ALTO clients that can be
      authenticated by the internal or external authorization server.
      This basic model only includes authentication approach directly
      provided by the HTTP or TLS server, but the operators or future
      documents can augment the "authentication" choice for different
      authentication mechanisms.

   *  "role" defines a list of roles for access control.  Each role
      contains a list of authenticated ALTO clients.  Each client can be
      assigned to multiple roles.  The "role-name" can be referenced by
      the "accepted-role" list of a "resource".  If an authenticated
      ALTO client is included in any roles with access permission to a
      resource, the client is granted access to that resource.

6.  Design of ALTO O&M Statistics Data Model

   The "ietf-alto-stats" module augments the "ietf-alto" module to
   include statistics at the ALTO server and information resource level
   (Figure 10).

           module: ietf-alto-stats

             augment /alto:alto/alto:alto-server:

6.1.  Model for ALTO Server Failure Monitoring

   To satisfy R6 in Section 4.2, the "ietf-alto-stats" module contains
   statistics that indicate server failures (Figure 10).

   More specifically, "num-total-*" and "num-total-last-*" provide
   server-level failure counters; "num-res-*" and "num-res-last-*"
   provide information resource-level failure counters.

6.2.  Model for ALTO-specific Performance Monitoring

   To satisfy R7 in Section 4.2, the "ietf-alto-stats" module also
   contains statistics for ALTO-specific performance metrics
   (Figure 10).

   More specifically, this data model contains the following measurement
   information of "system and service performance" suggested by
   [RFC7285] and [RFC7971]:

   *  Requests and responses for each information resource

   *  CPU and memory utilization

   *  ALTO map updates

   *  Number of PIDs

   *  ALTO map sizes

   Besides the above measurement information suggested by [RFC7285] and
   [RFC7971], the "ietf-alto-stats" module also contains useful
   measurement information for other ALTO extensions:

   *  "num-map-entry" and "num-base-obj" provide measurement for number
      of generic ALTO entities (for [RFC9240] and [RFC9241])

   *  "num-upd-stream" and "num-upd-msg-*" provide statistics for update
      streams and messages (for [RFC8189])

   The "ietf-alto-stats" module only focuses on the performance metrics
   that can be directly measured at the ALTO server.  The following
   metrics for "measurement of the impact" suggested by [RFC7971] are
   not contained in this data model:

   *  Total amount and distribution of traffic

   *  Application performance

8.  Security Considerations

   The "ietf-alto" and "ietf-alto-stats" YANG modules specified in this
   document define a schema for data that is designed to be accessed via
   network management protocols such as NETCONF [RFC6241] or RESTCONF
   [RFC8040].  The lowest NETCONF layer is the secure transport layer,
   and the mandatory-to-implement secure transport is Secure Shell (SSH)
   [RFC6242].  The lowest RESTCONF layer is HTTPS, and the mandatory-to-
   implement secure transport is TLS [RFC8446].

   The Network Configuration Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341]
   provides the means to restrict access for particular NETCONF or
   RESTCONF users to a preconfigured subset of all available NETCONF or
   RESTCONF protocol operations and content.

   There are a number of data nodes defined in these two YANG modules
   that are writable/creatable/deletable (i.e., config true, which is
   the default).  These data nodes may be considered sensitive or
   vulnerable in some network environments.  Write operations (e.g.,
   edit-config) and delete operations to these data nodes without proper
   protection or authentication can have a negative effect on network
   operations.  These are the subtrees and data nodes and their
   sensitivity/ vulnerability:

   "/alto/alto-client/server-discovery":  This subtree specifies a set
      of parameters for an ALTO client to discover ALTO servers.
      Unauthorized access to it could cause intruders to modify the ALTO
      discovery parameters (e.g., "dns-server") in order to expose an
      ALTO client to fake ALTO servers.  Likewise, this data node can be
      manipulated to prevent an ALTO client from discovering a reachable
      ALTO server.

   "/alto/alto-server/auth-client":  This list specifies all the
      authenticated ALTO clients on an ALTO server.  Unauthorized write
      access to this list can allow intruders to modify the entries so
      as to add a client that have not been authenticated yet or delete
      a client that has already been authenticated.  Likewise, this data
      node can be manipulated to prevent access of legitimate ALTO
      clients.

   "/alto/alto-server/role":  This list specifies roles which
      authenticated ALTO clients were assigned to for access control.
      Unauthorized write access to this list allow intruders to modify
      the entries so as to permit access that should not be permitted,
      or deny access that should be permitted.

   Some of the readable data nodes in the "ietf-alto" YANG module may be
   considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network environments.  It
   is thus important to control read access (e.g., via get, get-config,
   or notification) to these data nodes.  These are the subtrees and
   data nodes and their sensitivity/vulnerability:

   "/alto/alto-server/logging-system":  This subtree provides
      configuration to select a logging system to capture log messages
      generated by an ALTO server.  Unauthorized read access of this
      node can allow intruders to access logging information, which
      could be used to craft an attack the server.

   The "ietf-alto" supports an HTTP listen mode to cover cases where the
   ALTO server stack does not handle the TLS termination itself, but is
   handled by a separate component.  Special care should be considered
   when such mode is enabled.  Note that the default listen mode is
   "https".

   Also, please be aware that these modules include choice nodes that
   can be augmented by other extended modules.  The augmented data nodes
   may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
   environments.  For instance, an augmented case of the "source-params"
   choice in "data-source" may include authentication information about
   how to access a data source including private network information.
   The "yang-datastore" case in Appendix A.3 is such an example.  The
   "restconf" and "netconf" nodes in it may reveal the access to a
   private YANG datastore.  Thus, those extended modules may have the
   NACM extension "default-deny-all" set.

   These modules use groupings defined in other RFCs that define data
   nodes that do set the NACM "default-deny-all" and "default-deny-
   write" extensions.  Specifically, the following data nodes reuse
   groupings with their security considerations:

   "/alto/alto-server/listen/http/http-server-parameters":  This subtree
      reuses the "http-server-grouping" grouping defined in
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-http-client-server].  The security
      considerations of [I-D.ietf-netconf-http-client-server] have been
      applied to it.  Specifically, the "server-name" and "client-
      authentication" nodes in it may be considered sensitive or
      vulnerable.  For this reason, the NACM extension "default-deny-
      write" has been applied to them.

   "/alto/alto-server/listen/https/http-server-parameters":  This
      subtree reuses the "http-server-grouping" grouping defined in
      [I-D.ietf-netconf-http-client-server].  The security
      considerations of [I-D.ietf-netconf-http-client-server] have been
      applied to it.  Specifically, the "server-name"and "client-
      authentication" nodes in it may be considered sensitive or
      vulnerable.  For this reason, the NACM extension "default-deny-
      write" has been applied to them.

   "/alto/alto-server/listen/https/tls-server-parameters":  This subtree
      reuses the "tls-server-grouping" grouping defined in [RFC9645].
      The security considerations of [RFC9645] have been applied to it.
      Specifically, all the "key" and "private-key" data nodes in it
      have the NACM extension "default-deny-all" set, thus preventing
      unrestricted read-access to the cleartext key values.  Also, all
      writable data nodes in it may be considered sensitive or
      vulnerable.  For this reason, the NACM extension "default-deny-
      write" has been applied to them.

Appendix A.  Examples of Extending the ALTO O&M Data Model

   Developers and operators can also extend the ALTO O&M data model to
   align with their own implementations.  Specifically, the following
   nodes of the data model can be augmented:

   *  The server-discovery-manner choice of the server-discovery.

   *  The authentication choice of each auth-client.

   *  The data-source node.

   *  The algorithm choice of the resource-params of each resource.

A.1.  An Example Module for Extended Server Discovery Manners

   The base module "ietf-alto" only includes a reverse DNS based server
   discovery manner.  The following example module demonstrates how
   additional server discovery methods can be augmented into the base
   data model.

   The case internet-routing-registry allows the ALTO server to update
   the server URI to the attribute of the corresponding aut-num class in
   IRR.

   The case peeringdb allows the ALTO server to update the server URI to
   the org object of the organization record in PeeringDB.

A.2.  An Example Module for Extended Client Authentication Approaches

   The base module "ietf-alto" only includes the client authentication
   approaches directly provided by the HTTP server.  However, an
   implementation may authenticate clients in different ways.  For
   example, an implementation may delegate the authentication to a
   third-party OAuth 2.0 server.  The following example module
   demonstrates how additional client authentication approaches can
   enrich the base data model.

   In this example, the oauth2 case includes the URI to a third-party
   OAuth 2.0 based authorization server that the ALTO server can
   redirect to for the client authentication.

   module example-alto-auth {
     yang-version 1.1;

     namespace "https://example.com/ns/example-alto-auth";

A.3.  Example Module for Extended Data Sources

   The base module "ietf-alto" does not include any choice cases for
   specific data sources.  The following example module demonstrates how
   a implementation-specific data source can be augmented into the base
   data model.

   The yang-datastore case is used to import the YANG data from a YANG
   model-driven datastore.  It includes:

   *  datastore to indicate which datastore is fetched.

   *  target-paths to specify the list of nodes or subtrees in the
      datastore.

   *  protocol to indicate which protocol is used to access the
      datastore.  Either restconf or netconf can be used.

A.4.  An Example Module for Information Resource Creation Algorithm

   The base module "ietf-alto" does not include any choices cases for
   information resource creation algorithms.  But developers may augment
   the "ietf-alto" module with definitions for custom creation
   algorithms for different information resources.  The following
   example module demonstrates the parameters of a network map creation
   algorithm that translates an IETF Layer 3 unicast topology into a
   network map.

   module: example-alto-alg

     augment /alto:alto/alto:alto-server/alto:resource
               /alto:alto-networkmap-params/alto:algorithm:
       +--:(l3-unicast-cluster)
          +--rw l3-unicast-cluster-algorithm
             +--rw l3-unicast-topo
             |  +--rw source-datastore    alto:data-source-ref
             |  +--rw topo-name?          leafref
             +--rw depth?             uint32

   This example defines a creation algorithm called l3-unicast-cluster-
   algorithm for the network map resource.  It takes two algorithm-
   specific parameters:

   'l3-unicast-topo':  This parameter contains information referring to
      the target path name of an operational yang-datastore data source
      node (See Appendix A.3) subscribed in the data-source list (See
      Section 5.4.1).  The referenced target path in the corresponding
      yang-datastore data source is assumed for an IETF layer 3 unicast
      topology defined in [RFC8346].  The algorithm uses the topology
      data from this data source to compute the ALTO network map
      resource. 'source-datastore' refers to the 'source-id' of the
      operational yang-datastore data source node, and 'topo-name'
      refers to the 'name' of the target path in the source datastore.

   'depth':  This optional parameter sets the depth of the clustering
      algorithm.  For example, if the depth is set to 1, the algorithm
      will generate PID for every l3-node in the topology.

   The creation algorithm can be reactively called once the referenced
   data source updates.  Therefore, the ALTO network map resource can be
   updated dynamically.

Appendix B.  A Sample ALTO Server Architecture to Implement ALTO O&M
             YANG Modules

   Figure 11 shows a sample architecture for an ALTO server
   implementation.  It indicates the major server components that an
   ALTO server usually needs to include and the YANG modules that these
   server components need to implement.

      This section does not intend to impose an internal structure of
      server implementations, but is provided to exemplify how the
      various data model components can be used, including having
      provisions for future augmentations.

   The following server components need to implement the 'ietf-alto'
   module (Section 5):

   Server manager:  Provides the functionality and configuration of the
      server-level management, including server listen stack setup,
      server discovery setup, logging system configuration, global
      metadata, and server-level security configuration.

   Information resource manager:  Provides the operation and management
      for creating, updating, and removing ALTO information resources.

   Data source listener:  An ALTO server may start multiple data source
      listeners.  Each data source listener defines a communication
      endpoint that can fetch ALTO-related information from data
      sources.  The information can be either raw network/computation
      information or pre-processed ALTO-level information.

   The following components need to implement the 'ietf-alto-stats'
   module (Section 6) to provide statistics information:

   Performance monitor:  Collects ALTO-specific performance metrics at a
      running ALTO server.

   Logging and fault manager:  Collects runtime logs and failure events
      that are generated by an ALTO server and the service of each ALTO
      information resource.

   The following components are also important for an ALTO server,
   although they are not in the scope of the data models defined in this
   document:

   Data broker:  An ALTO server may implement a data broker to store
      network/computation information collected from data sources or
      cache some preprocessed data.  The service of the ALTO information
      resource can read them from the data broker to calculate ALTO
      responses and return to ALTO clients.

   Algorithm plugin:  The service of each ALTO information resource
      needs to configure an algorithm to decide how to calculate the
      ALTO responses.  The algorithm plugins implement those algorithms.
      User-specified YANG modules can be applied to different algorithm
      plugins by augmenting the ALTO modules (Appendix A).

   Generally, the ALTO server components illustrated above have the
   following interactions with each other:

   *  Both the server manager and information resource manager will
      report statistics data to the performance monitor and the logging
      and fault manager.

   *  The algorithm plugins will register callbacks to the corresponding
      ALTO information resources upon configuration; Once an ALTO
      information resource is requested, the registered callback
      algorithm will be invoked.

   *  A data source listener will fetch data from the configured data
      source using the corresponding data source API in either proactive
      mode (polling) or reactive mode (subscription/publication).

   *  A data source listener will send the preprocessed data to a data
      broker.

   *  An algorithm plugin may read data from an optional data broker to
      calculate the ALTO information resource.
